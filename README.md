# StarcraftII_Agent_AI

## Project Outline

### 1. Build basic agent (complete)
Use the documentation from PySC2 to install Starcraft II and get a basic agent running that can perform (pretty poorly) the minigame tasks. This is the starting point for understanding reinforcement learning to build upon.

### 2. Implement Temporal Differencing and evaluate
Use the framework from step one to implement TD Lambda and perhaps other methods and try to improve the agent's behavior. I intend to use the mineral gathering minigame to test this agent's performance against the previous.

### 3. Policy Gradients
Explore policy gradient methods to see if they improve upon TD Lambda.

### 4. Deep Q-Learning
What I anticipate will work best, but also be the most difficult to implement. If this succeeds, I would then begin to train the agent on replay data so it can learn to play the real game and see how far I can push this!
